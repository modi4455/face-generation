# face-generation
Fourth project for Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree
## Project Overview
This repository hosts code used in fourth project on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) project in the Deep Learning Nanodegree. In addition to meeting the project specifications, I also added on a few things.

The aim is to use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.
## Getting started
Open the face_generation.ipynb on a GPU enabled Python notebook environment, or Google colab (a link is directly on top in the notebook file). The notebook consists of further technical details. Run the notebook to generate your own unique and random face images.
